# create file manager to handle absolute file page addressing
  d page addresses can be outside current file_mapping.
  d means classes should not bother with mapped_region, just char*
  d enable mapping larger areas of file to memory directly (regions)
  d keep track of mapped regions to avoid re-mapping regions
  d handle file allocation

# do hash table lookups in fs a bit cleaner
  . refactor of fs::find_table

# query evaluation
  . query parsing
  . evaluation mechanism, streams?
  . evaluation optimizations, fill-sequence syncronization

# data transformation in scala?
  . might be easier to implement transform layer in scala
  . transform DSL -> functional programming
  . not where performance is critical
