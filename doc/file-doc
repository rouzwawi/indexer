== Terminology

# Column
Indexing is done on the scope of columns, so everything discussed is within the scope of
one column of data and all the values that column contains.

# Bitmap
A bitmap is a full index on one column. It covers all distinct values of that colum. The
bitmap consist of a linked list of of index pages and a heap of data pages.

# Bitmap index page
An index page of the bitmap is a lookup table from column values to index data pages for
the corresponding value.

# Bitmap data page
A data page contains pure WAH encoded bitmap data.

== Data file page definitions

# Size definitions

ps = 4KiB # page size
ds = 8MiB, 16MiB, 32MiB, 64MiB, 128MiB, 256MiB, 512MiB, 1024MiB... # data file size
pd = mmf::file_size(file) / PAGE_SIZE # pages per datafile


# Page types:
fs_hash_table
bitmap_index_page
bitmap_data_page


# Page type descriptors
Field sizes are expressed in number of size units (u), which is one byte.
u4 = 4 bytes = 32 bit int
u8 = 8 bytes = 64 bit long
u4[16] = array of sixteen 32 bit ints

all fields are unsigned unless explicitly commented to be something else

fs_hash_table:
	u4				0x72786469			# magic word "idxr"
	u4[15]			reserved			# empty for future header use
	u4[8][113]		hash_table			# hash_table entries
	u4[104]			reserved			# waste

	4*(1 + 15 + 8*113 + 104) == 4KiB

	expl:
		First page of a data file with file system is always the 0th hash_table page.
		Hash table pages contain mappings from filenames to page adresses of the first file page.
		Each table entry contains a sha1 hash, some flags, a page address and a 'next' pointer.
		The 'next' pointers point to another fs_hash_table page, used for collisions.
		See 'struct hash_entry' in fs.hpp

bitmap_index_page:
	ux				x							#TODO hash-map with chaining?

	expl:
		An instance of Bitmap should always be pointed to the first index page of that bitmap.

bitmap_data_page:
	u4				next_page
	u8[(ps-4)/8]	data
